# sat-helmholtz
Helmholtz cage magnetic field model

The model is fully applicable and practical for most design and analysis purposes. Running the script results in a figure with an example plot of magnetic field  lines in the 0yz plane for a field generated by a pair of Helmholtz coils wound around the 0y axis. Each line has been obtained by solving (for different initial conditions) a set of ordinary differential equations with right-hand-side expressions dependent on the magnetic field vector. For this task, we used the ode45 function available in MATLAB. 

It took about 50 seconds to draw the plot (ntel Core i7-1065G7 CPU).
